-> While logging in with username=user1@gmail.com and password=user1ABC,
Repository method was returning 2 identical records from database with
same login parameters.


-> The database entries that are being bootstrapped at launching of application
was sending duplicate entries to database for user1@gmail.com,which was causing issue.


-->To make database entries unique,I made changes in >db/changelog/db.changelog-1.0.xml
file,so the database will have only unique login credentials(LOGIN_ID) for users.
